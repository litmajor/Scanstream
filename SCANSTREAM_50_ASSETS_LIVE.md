## 🔄 Signal Generation Pipeline

Each of the 50 assets flows through:

```
Gateway (Real-time price data)
         ↓
Scanner (Pattern detection - 28 patterns × 50 assets)
         ↓
ML Engine (Ensemble predictions across 67+ features)
         ↓
RL Agent (Q-learning from market conditions)
         ↓
Consensus Engine (3-source voting with weights)
         ↓
Quality Scoring (0-100 with historical accuracy adjustment)
         ↓
User Dashboard (Ranked signals with full transparency)
```

**Total Signal Capacity: 50 assets × 28 patterns × 3 sources = 4,200+ potential signals**
