# 🚀 Medium Features Guide

## Advanced Trading System Enhancements

This guide covers the 4 medium-complexity features that transform your scanner into a professional-grade trading system:

1. **Market Regime Detector** - Adaptive market analysis
2. **Multi-Timeframe Confluence** - Cross-timeframe validation
3. **Risk/Reward Optimizer** - Professional position sizing
4. **Smart Alerts System** - Real-time opportunity notifications

---

## 1. 📈 Market Regime Detector

### What It Does

Automatically detects whether the current market is in a **Bull**, **Bear**, or **Ranging** regime and adjusts strategy accordingly.

### How It Works

The regime detector analyzes:
- **EMA Alignment** (20, 50, 200 periods)
- **ADX** (trend strength)
- **Price Action** (20d and 50d returns)
- **Volatility** (ATR percentage)

**Classification Logic:**
```
Bull Regime:
✓ Price above EMA20, EMA50, EMA200
✓ EMAs properly aligned (20 > 50 > 200)
✓ Positive 20d/50d returns
✓ ADX > 20 (trending)

Bear Regime:
✓ Price below EMAs
✓ EMAs inverted (200 > 50 > 20)
✓ Negative returns
✓ ADX > 20 (trending down)

Ranging Regime:
✓ ADX < 20 (low trend strength)
✓ Price oscillating around EMAs
✓ Low volatility (< 3%)
```

### Display

Each signal card now shows:

```
Market Regime: [BULL] 85% 📊
```

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 **BULL** (Green badge) - Uptrend identified
- 🔴 **BEAR** (Red badge) - Downtrend identified  
- 🟡 **RANGING** (Yellow badge) - Sideways market

**Volatility Icons:**
- 🔥 High volatility (>3.5% ATR)
- 📊 Medium volatility (1.5-3.5%)
- 😴 Low volatility (<1.5%)

### Adaptive Opportunity Thresholds

The regime automatically adjusts opportunity score requirements:

| Regime | Suggested Threshold | Reasoning |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Bull** | 60% | Easier to find good longs |
| **Bear** | 75% | Harder to find good longs |
| **Ranging** | 80% | Wait for clear breakouts |

### Trading Implications

**In Bull Markets:**
- ✅ More aggressive with longs
- ✅ Wider stops (trend can continue)
- ✅ Hold positions longer
- ❌ Avoid fighting the trend

**In Bear Markets:**
- ⚠️ Very selective with longs
- ✅ Tighter stops
- ✅ Quick profits
- ✅ Consider shorts (if supported)

**In Ranging Markets:**
- ⚠️ Wait for breakouts
- ✅ Buy at support, sell at resistance
- ✅ Mean reversion strategies
- ❌ Avoid trend-following

### API Endpoint

```
GET /api/scanner/signals
```

Response includes:
```json
{
  "market_regime": {
    "regime": "bull",
    "confidence": 85,
    "trend_strength": 45.2,
    "volatility": "medium",
    "suggested_threshold": 60
  }
}
```

## 2. 🎯 Multi-Timeframe Confluence

### What It Does

Analyzes a symbol across multiple timeframes (e.g., 1h, 4h, 1d) to find **confluence** - when signals align across timeframes for higher probability setups.

### Why It Matters

**Single Timeframe Problem:**
- ❌ 1h shows buy, but 1d shows sell = conflict
- ❌ Missing bigger picture context
- ❌ Lower win rate

**Multi-Timeframe Solution:**
- ✅ All timeframes agree = high confidence
- ✅ Higher win rate (typically 60-70% vs 45-55%)
- ✅ Better entries and exits

### How To Use

**API Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/scanner/multi-timeframe
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
  "timeframes": ["short", "medium", "daily"],
  "minOpportunity": 65
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
  "confluence": true,
  "timeframes_analyzed": 3,
  "average_opportunity": 78.5,
  "bullish_timeframes": 3,
  "bearish_timeframes": 0,
  "dominant_regime": "bull",
  "timeframe_results": [
    {
      "timeframe": "short",
      "signal": "Buy",
      "opportunity_score": 75,
      "market_regime": "bull",
      "price": 45000,
      "rsi": 42
    },
    {
      "timeframe": "medium",
      "signal": "Strong Buy",
      "opportunity_score": 82,
      "market_regime": "bull",
      "price": 45000,
      "rsi": 38
    },
    {
      "timeframe": "daily",
      "signal": "Buy",
      "opportunity_score": 78,
      "market_regime": "bull",
      "price": 45000,
      "rsi": 45
    }
  ],
  "recommendation": "STRONG"
}
```

### Confluence Criteria

**STRONG Recommendation:**
- ✅ All timeframes aligned (3/3 bullish or bearish)
- ✅ Average opportunity > 75
- ✅ Minimum opportunity across all TFs > 65

**MODERATE Recommendation:**
- ✅ 2/3 timeframes aligned
- ✅ Average opportunity > 65

**WEAK Recommendation:**
- ⚠️ No clear consensus
- ⚠️ Conflicting signals
- ❌ Don't trade

### Example Workflow

```javascript
// Check BTC across timeframes
const response = await fetch('/api/scanner/multi-timeframe', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    symbol: 'BTC/USDT',
    timeframes: ['short', 'medium', 'daily'],
    minOpportunity: 65
  })
});

const result = await response.json();

if (result.confluence && result.recommendation === 'STRONG') {
  // All systems go! Strong confluence
  console.log('✅ STRONG BUY - All timeframes aligned');
  console.log(`Average Opportunity: ${result.average_opportunity}%`);
  // Execute trade
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always check 3 timeframes minimum:**
   - Short-term (1h) - Entry timing
   - Medium-term (4h) - Swing direction  
   - Long-term (1d) - Overall trend

2. **Require 2/3 agreement:**
   - Perfect 3/3 is rare
   - 2/3 with strong opportunity = tradeable

3. **Watch for divergences:**
   - If daily is bearish but 1h is bullish = range-bound
   - Don't force trades

4. **Use dominant regime:**
   - If dominant regime is bull, bias longs
   - If dominant regime is bear, pass on longs

## 3. 💰 Risk/Reward Optimizer (Position Sizing)

### What It Does

Calculates the **optimal position size** based on:
- Account balance
- Risk percentage per trade
- Entry price
- Stop-loss distance
- Leverage (optional)
- Trading fees

### The Formula

```
Position Size = (Account × Risk %) / Stop Distance %

Example:
Account: $10,000
Risk: 2% = $200
Entry: $45,000
Stop: $43,000
Stop Distance: 4.44%

Position Size = $200 / 0.0444 = $4,504
Units = $4,504 / $45,000 = 0.1001 BTC
```

### API Endpoint

```
POST /api/position/calculate
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "accountBalance": 10000,
  "riskPerTrade": 2,
  "entryPrice": 45000,
  "stopLoss": 43000,
  "leverage": 1,
  "feeRate": 0.001
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "position_value": 4504.50,
  "units": 0.1001,
  "margin_required": 4504.50,
  "risk_amount_usd": 200,
  "adjusted_risk_usd": 191,
  "total_fees": 9.01,
  "stop_distance_pct": 4.44,
  "stop_distance_usd": 200,
  "leverage": 1,
  "liquidation_price": null,
  "account_balance": 10000,
  "risk_per_trade_pct": 2,
  "margin_usage_pct": 45.05,
  "warnings": [],
  "safe_to_trade": true
}
```

### Warnings System

The calculator warns you about dangerous situations:

```json
{
  "warnings": [
    "Insufficient balance for this position",
    "Position uses >50% of account (high risk)",
    "High leverage (5x) - increased liquidation risk",
    "Risking 5% per trade (recommended: 1-2%)",
    "Liquidation price is beyond stop-loss - very risky!"
  ],
  "safe_to_trade": false
}
```

### Recommended Risk Levels

| Experience | Risk Per Trade | Max Positions |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Beginner** | 0.5-1% | 2-3 |
| **Intermediate** | 1-2% | 3-5 |
| **Advanced** | 2-3% | 5-7 |
| **Professional** | 3-5% | 7-10 |

⚠️ **Never risk more than 5% per trade!**

### Leverage Warnings

| Leverage | Risk Level | Liquidation Risk |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| **1x** | 🟢 Low | None |
| **2-3x** | 🟡 Medium | Moderate |
| **4-5x** | 🟠 High | High |
| **> 5x** | 🔴 Extreme | Very High |

### Frontend Integration

The scanner automatically calculates position size for you based on:
- Your account balance (configurable)
- Your risk % (configurable)
- The signal's entry and stop-loss

Just click on a signal to see:
```
Position Calculator
Account: $10,000  Risk: 2%
Buy 0.1001 BTC @ $45,000
Risking: $200  Margin: $4,505
```

## 4. 🔔 Smart Alerts System

### What It Does

Sends **browser notifications** when excellent trading opportunities appear (opportunity score ≥ threshold).

### Features

1. **Real-time notifications** when new scans find high-quality setups
2. **Configurable threshold** (default: 80)
3. **No duplicates** - won't spam you with same symbol
4. **Requires interaction** - notification stays until you dismiss

### Setup

**1. Enable Notifications:**

Click the **"Alerts"** button in the scanner header:

```
[🔔 Alerts]  ← Click to enable
```

**2. Grant Permission:**

Browser will ask: "Allow notifications?"
→ Click **"Allow"**

**3. Configure Threshold:**

```javascript
// In scanner settings
alertThreshold: 80  // Only notify for 80+ opportunities
```

**4. Scan as normal:**

When scanner finds a signal with opportunity ≥ 80:

```
🎯 Excellent Trading Opportunity!
BTC/USDT: 92/100 opportunity score
Signal: BUY | R:R: 2.75
```

### How It Works

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!alertsEnabled || !scannerData?.signals) return;

  scannerData.signals.forEach(signal => {
    const opportunityScore = signal.advanced?.opportunity_score || 0;
    
    if (opportunityScore >= alertThreshold && 
        Notification.permission === 'granted') {
      
      new Notification('🎯 Excellent Trading Opportunity!', {
        body: `${signal.symbol}: ${opportunityScore}/100 opportunity score\nSignal: ${signal.signal} | R:R: ${signal.risk_reward?.risk_reward_ratio}`,
        tag: signal.symbol,  // Prevents duplicates
        requireInteraction: true
      });
    }
  });
}, [scannerData, alertsEnabled, alertThreshold]);
```

### Alert Levels

Set different thresholds based on your strategy:

| Threshold | Frequency | Quality |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **90+** | Rare (1-2/day) | Exceptional |
| **80-89** | Low (3-5/day) | Excellent |
| **70-79** | Medium (5-10/day) | Good |
| **60-69** | High (10-20/day) | Acceptable |

### Best Practices

**1. Don't Set Too Low:**
- ❌ Threshold 50 = constant spam
- ✅ Threshold 75-80 = quality signals only

**2. Combine With Watchlist:**
- Add favorite pairs to watchlist
- Set alerts for watchlist only
- Get notified only for BTC, ETH, etc.

**3. Desktop Notifications:**
- Works even when browser is minimized
- Won't miss opportunities while working
- Sound notifications (browser dependent)

**4. Mobile Support:**
- Works on mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari)
- Must keep tab open (PWA support coming)

### Notification Actions (Future)

Planned enhancements:
```
🎯 BTC/USDT: 92/100 opportunity

[View Signal]  [Trade Now]  [Dismiss]
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Market Regime Shows "Unknown"

**Issue**: Regime detector isn't working

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure scanner has enough data (200+ candles)
2. Check that scan completed successfully
3. Verify backend logs for errors
4. Try different timeframe (1d works best)

### Multi-Timeframe Returns "No Data"

**Issue**: Symbol not found across timeframes

**Solutions:**
1. Use exact symbol format: "BTC/USDT" not "BTCUSDT"
2. Ensure symbol exists on exchange
3. Check scanner has scanned that timeframe
4. Try lowercase: "btcusdt" → "BTC/USDT"

### Position Calculator Shows Warnings

**Issue**: "Insufficient balance" or "Liquidation risk"

**Solutions:**
1. **Insufficient balance**: Reduce position or account size
2. **>50% margin**: Lower risk % or use wider stop
3. **High leverage**: Reduce leverage to 1-3x
4. **Liquidation risk**: Don't use leverage or widen stop

### Alerts Not Working

**Issue**: No browser notifications

**Solutions:**
1. **Click "Alerts" button** to request permission
2. **Browser settings**: Check notifications allowed for site
3. **Operating system**: Check notification settings
4. **Browser tab**: Must be open (minimized OK)
5. **HTTPS required**: Localhost works, HTTP doesn't
