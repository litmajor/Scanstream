# Enhanced Opportunity Scoring Guide

## 🎯 Problem We Solved

The original scanner was ranking assets with high momentum scores, which often meant **overbought assets** that had already made their move. This led to poor entry points with limited upside and high risk.

## ✅ The Solution: Opportunity Score

We've implemented a new **Opportunity Score** that identifies the **BEST entry points**, not just the strongest momentum. The scanner now finds:

- ✅ **Pullbacks in uptrends** - Perfect buy opportunities
- ✅ **Value zones** - Assets near support with room to run
- ✅ **Strong trends with good entries** - Not chasing pumps
- ✅ **High volume accumulation** - Smart money activity
- ❌ **Penalizes overbought** - RSI > 70, extended moves
- ❌ **Avoids catching knives** - Downtrends without confirmation

## 📊 How Opportunity Score Works

The Opportunity Score (0-100) analyzes **8 key factors**:

### 1. RSI Opportunity (25% weight)
**Best opportunities occur when RSI is in the "sweet spot"**

| RSI Range | Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| < 30 | 0.3 | Oversold - risky (falling knife) |
| 30-45 | **1.0** | 🟢 **IDEAL** - Pullback in uptrend |
| 45-55 | 0.8 | Neutral - acceptable |
| 55-70 | 0.5 | Getting extended |
| > 70 | 0.2 | 🔴 Overbought - poor entry |

### 2. Bollinger Band Position (20% weight)
**Lower BB positions indicate better value**

| BB Position | Score | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| < 0.3 | **1.0** | 🟢 Near lower band - great entry |
| 0.3-0.5 | 0.9 | Below midline - good |
| 0.5-0.7 | 0.6 | Above midline - okay |
| > 0.7 | 0.2 | 🔴 Near upper band - overbought |

### 3. Stochastic Oscillator (15% weight)
**Oversold stochastic in uptrend = buy signal**

| Stoch %K | In Uptrend | Score |
|----------|------------|-------|
| < 20 | Yes | **1.0** 🟢 Perfect setup |
| < 20 | No | 0.3 Risky |
| 20-40 | - | 0.9 Good |
| 40-60 | - | 0.7 Neutral |
| 60-80 | - | 0.4 Extended |
| > 80 | - | 0.1 🔴 Overbought |

### 4. Momentum Context (15% weight)
**Identifies pullbacks in trends**

| Long-term | Short-term | Score | Setup Type |
|-----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Uptrend | Slight pullback | **1.0** 🟢 | **Perfect** - Buy the dip |
| Uptrend | Strong momentum | 0.4 | Already running |
| Downtrend | Slight bounce | 1.0 | Good short entry |
| Flat | Any | 0.5 | Neutral |

### 5. Volume Context (10% weight)
**High volume at low prices = accumulation**

| Volume Ratio | RSI | Score | Interpretation |
|--------------|-----|-------|----------------|
| > 1.5x | < 55 | **1.0** 🟢 | Accumulation |
| > 1.5x | > 70 | 0.3 | Distribution |
| 1.2-1.5x | - | 0.8 | Good |
| 0.8-1.2x | - | 0.6 | Average |
| < 0.8x | - | 0.4 | Low conviction |

### 6. Trend Quality (10% weight)
**Strong trends provide better context**
- Score: `trend_score / 10` (normalized to 0-1)
- Higher trend quality = better probability

### 7. MACD Context (5% weight)
**Slight negative MACD in uptrend = pullback**

| Long Momentum | MACD | Score |
|---------------|------|-------|
| Positive | -0.5 to 0 | **1.0** 🟢 Pullback |
| Any | 0 to 2 | 0.7 Moderate |
| Any | > 2 | 0.3 Overextended |

### 8. Divergence Penalty
**Bearish divergence = warning sign**
- If bearish RSI divergence detected: **Score × 0.5**
- Divergence indicates potential top/reversal

## 🔢 Combined Score Formula

The final ranking uses **Opportunity Score as the primary factor**:

```
Combined Score = 
    Opportunity Score    × 50%  ← Primary factor (finding best entries)
  + Composite Score      × 25%  ← Technical strength
  + Volume Composite     × 15%  ← Volume profile analysis
  + Signal Strength      × 10%  ← Signal conviction
```

### Before vs After

**BEFORE (Old System):**
```
Combined Score = 
    Composite Score × 50%     ← Rewarded high momentum (overbought)
  + Volume Score    × 30%
  + Signal Strength × 20%
```

**AFTER (New System):**
```
Combined Score = 
    Opportunity Score × 50%    ← Finds best entry points
  + Composite Score   × 25%    ← Reduced weight on raw momentum
  + Volume Score      × 15%
  + Signal Strength   × 10%
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage Tips

### 1. Combine with Signal Type
- **BUY signals** with high opportunity score (70+) = Best long setups
- **SELL signals** ignored (we're focused on longs)
- **HOLD signals** with high opportunity (60+) = Accumulation zone

### 2. Filter Strategy
```
Recommended Filters:
- Signal Type: BUY
- Min Opportunity Score: 65
- Timeframe: Medium (1h) or Daily
- RSI: 30-60 (avoid extremes)
```

### 3. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation
- High opportunity on **daily** = Strong trend setup
- High opportunity on **1h** = Good intraday entry
- Agreement across timeframes = Highest confidence

### 4. Watch for Divergence
- Opportunity score includes divergence penalty
- Manual check: Compare price highs vs RSI highs
- Divergence = reduce position size or wait

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Key Concepts
1. **Pullback Trading** - Buying temporary weakness in strong trends
2. **Mean Reversion** - Assets return to average after extremes
3. **Overbought/Oversold** - RSI, Stoch, BB extremes
4. **Volume Profile** - Where smart money accumulates
5. **Divergence** - Price vs indicator disagreement (warning)

### Best Practices
- Never buy RSI > 70 unless extraordinary circumstances
- Look for volume spikes at lower prices (accumulation)
- Use opportunity score + manual chart check
- Set alerts for high-opportunity setups (75+)
- Be patient - best setups are rare

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

The opportunity scoring can be fine-tuned based on your preferences:

### Adjust for Different Strategies

**Aggressive (High Growth)**
- Increase momentum_opp weight
- Accept higher RSI (up to 60)
- Focus on strong trends only

**Conservative (Value)**
- Increase bb_opp weight
- Favor RSI 30-45 only
- Require divergence check

**Swing Trading**
- Use daily timeframe
- Opportunity score > 70
- Hold for trend resumption

**Day Trading**
- Use 1h or 5m timeframe
- Opportunity score > 65
- Quick entries on pullbacks
