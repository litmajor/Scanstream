Concept 3: Pattern Quality Enhancement
Your ML is Best (51% win rate) - Let's Make It 60%+
Why ML is Winning:
Your neural network is picking up subtle patterns that rule-based indicators miss:

Price-volume relationships
Multi-timeframe momentum
Order book imbalances (if you have that data)

How to Boost ML Performance:
python# ENHANCED ML FEATURE ENGINEERING

class MLFeatureEngineer:
    
    def generate_features(self, asset, lookback=60):
        """
        Current features you probably have:
        - Price (OHLC)
        - Volume
        - RSI, MACD, etc.
        
        ADD THESE:

ML Model Architecture Upgrade:
python# CURRENT (probably): Simple feedforward network
# UPGRADE TO: Ensemble with regime-specific models

class AdaptiveMLEnsemble:
    def __init__(self):
        # Train separate models for each market regime
        self.trending_model = train_model(regime='trending')
        self.choppy_model = train_model(regime='choppy')
        self.volatile_model = train_model(regime='volatile')
        
        # Meta-model to select which model to use
        self.regime_classifier = train_regime_classifier()
    
    def predict(self, asset, features):
        # Classify current market regime
        regime = self.regime_classifier.predict(features)
        
        # Use appropriate model
        if regime == 'trending':
            prediction = self.trending_model.predict(features)
            confidence_boost = 1.15  # Boost confidence in trending markets
        elif regime == 'choppy':
            prediction = self.choppy_model.predict(features)
            confidence_boost = 0.85  # Reduce confidence in choppy markets
        else:  # volatile
            prediction = self.volatile_model.predict(features)
            confidence_boost = 0.95
        
        return prediction * confidence_boost
Expected Impact:

ML win rate: 51% → 58-62% (regime-specific models)
ML patterns become primary signal source
Other patterns become confirmation only
