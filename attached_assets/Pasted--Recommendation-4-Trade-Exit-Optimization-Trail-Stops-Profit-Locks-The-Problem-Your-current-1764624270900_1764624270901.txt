🔥 Recommendation #4: Trade Exit Optimization (Trail Stops + Profit Locks)
The Problem:
Your current exits are probably:

Fixed take-profit: +2%
Fixed stop-loss: -5%
No adjustment as trade progresses

This means:

You exit winners too early (BTC runs 10%, you got 2%)
You hold losers too long (-5% stop when -2% would save you)

The Solution: Dynamic Trail Stops

# EXAMPLE COMPARISON:

# Trade: BTC entry $87,000

# --- SCENARIO 1: BTC rallies to $92,000 then drops to $89,500 ---

# CURRENT SYSTEM (fixed exits):
# Target: $88,740 (+2%) → EXITED at $88,740
# Profit: $1,740
# Missed: $3,500 (left on table when it hit $92k)

# DYNAMIC TRAIL STOP:
# $87,000 → $88,000: Stop at breakeven ($87,000)
# $88,000 → $90,000: Stop at $88,500 (lock 50% profit)
# $90,000 → $92,000: Stop trails to $90,200 (1.5× ATR)
# $92,000 → $89,500: Stop hit at $90,200
# Profit: $3,200 (+84% vs fixed exit)

# --- SCENARIO 2: BTC drops immediately ---

# CURRENT SYSTEM:
# Stop: $82,650 (-5%)
# Loss: -$4,350

# DYNAMIC SYSTEM (tighter initial stop):
# Stop: $85,260 (-2%)
# Loss: -$1,740
# Saved: $2,610 (60% less loss)
