# Frontend Session Summary - AlgoTrader Platform
*Complete overhaul of navigation, routing, and UI organization*

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Critical Routing Bug** (FIXED)
**Problem:** All pages displayed the same Dashboard content
- Scanner, Portfolio, Backtest, etc. showed identical content
- Routes were defined but never rendered

**Solution:**
- Fixed `client/src/App.tsx` to properly render Router component
- Added all missing routes including Paper Trading
- Verified routing works across all pages

---

### 2. **Variable Initialization Errors** (FIXED)
**Problem:** JavaScript errors breaking pages
- `chartData` accessed before initialization in `trading-terminal.tsx`
- `displaySignals` accessed before initialization in `scanner.tsx`

**Solution:**
- Moved variable definitions before queries that use them
- Fixed ARIA attribute validation errors
- All pages now load without errors

---

###3. **Favicon 404 Error** (FIXED)
**Problem:** Missing favicon causing console errors

**Solution:**
- Created `client/public/` directory
- Designed custom trading-themed SVG favicon
- Added favicon link to `client/index.html`

---

### 4. **Sidebar Integration Issues** (FIXED)
**Problem:** Overlapping navigation systems causing clutter
- App.tsx sidebar conflicted with page-specific layouts
- Unreadable content due to double navigation

**Solution:**
- Removed conflicting wrapper sidebar
- Let each page handle its own layout
- Clean, integrated design across all pages
