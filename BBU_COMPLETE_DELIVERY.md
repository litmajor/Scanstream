## 🎓 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### The Problem
```
Current System: All strategies weighted equally (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
Issue: Doesn't account for which strategy actually works best
```

### The Solution
```
BBU System: Learns from every trade
  Trade 1: Strategy A wins → Belief about A increases → Weight up
  Trade 2: Strategy B loses → Belief about B decreases → Weight down
  Trade 3: System uses new weights → Better signals
  
Result: Over time, best strategies naturally get higher weights
```

### The Math
```
When trade closes:
  P(Strategy is good | Trade result) = 
    P(Trade result | Strategy is good) × P(Strategy is good) / 
    P(Trade result)
  
  New Weight = Posterior Probability × Confidence
```
